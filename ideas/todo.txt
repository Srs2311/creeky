general:
    - improve portability
        - Torrent list has responsive design, other menu screens do not. Need to improve torrent list's responsiveness
    - Web interface
    - auto download feature based on filters (queue?)
    - ability to add torrent uploaders to approved uploaders list from inside tui
        - Pressing F while hovering over an uploader on torrent list or torrent menu should add to the uploaders list

Search menu
    - Sort type
    - Category-based search
    - exiting torrentlist back to search menu is not redrawing search menu

Documentation:
    - Review tui code, document and refactor as needed
