general:
    - improve portability
        - Torrent list has responsive design, other menu screens do not. Need to improve torrent list's responsiveness
    - Web interface
    - auto download feature based on filters (queue?)
    - Pull full torrent title from torrent page if title is too long for normal menu <- likely the nxt big fix. Will improve filtering a lot.
        - slows things down a toooooooon. link has full title in it. extracting from there.
    - Individual data gathering for torrent pages for most categories
    

Search menu
    - Category-based search
    - exiting torrentlist back to search menu is not redrawing search menu

Documentation:
    - Review tui code, document and refactor as needed
    - Better documentation on object structure

Add QbitTorrent Manager
    - view running Torrents
    - remove Torrents

Run from CLI
    - command to dl torrent from link

SQL database?

Automatic downloads
    - curatable queue?
