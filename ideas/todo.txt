general:
    - improve portability
        - Torrent list has responsive design, other menu screens do not. Need to improve torrent list's responsiveness
    - Web interface
    - auto download feature based on filters (queue?)
    - Pull full torrent title from torrent page if title is too long for normal menu
    - Individual data gathering for torrent pages for most categories
    

Search menu
    - Sort type
    - Category-based search
    - exiting torrentlist back to search menu is not redrawing search menu

Documentation:

    - Better documentation on object structure
